# Basic DSA questions
This repo contains basic DSA problems and their solutions

### Binary Tree min path

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

### DFS

Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice. To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.

### Climb Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
